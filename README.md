### Practical List

1. Given below is a dictionary having two keys ‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’ and having two lists of heights of five Boys and
Five Girls respectively as values associated with these keys
Original dictionary of lists:
{'Boys': [72, 68, 70, 69, 74], 'Girls': [63, 65, 69, 62, 61]}
From the given dictionary of lists create the following list of dictionaries:
[{'Boys': 72, 'Girls': 63}, {'Boys': 68, 'Girls': 65}, {'Boys': 70, 'Girls': 69}, {'Boys': 69, 'Girls': 62}, {‘Boys’:74,
‘Girls’:61] 
2. Write programs in Python using NumPy library to do the following:
a. Compute the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a two dimensional random integer array
along the second axis.
b. Get the indices of the sorted elements of a given array.
a. B = [56, 48, 22, 41, 78, 91, 24, 46, 8, 33]
c. Create a 2-dimensional array of size m x n integer elements, also print the shape, type and data
type of the array and then reshape it into nx m array, n and m are user inputs given at the run time.
d. Test whether the elements of a given array are zero, non-zero and NaN. Record the indices of
these elements in three separate arrays.
3. Create a dataframe having at least 3 columns and 50 rows to store numeric data generated using a random
function. Replace 10% of the values by null values whose index positions are generated using random function.
Do the following:
a. Identify and count missing values in a dataframe.
b. Drop the column having more than 5 null values.
c. Identify the row label having maximum of the sum of all values in a row and drop that row.
d. Sort the dataframe on the basis of the first column.
e. Remove all duplicates from the first column.
f. Find the correlation between first and second column and covariance between second and third
column.
g. Detect the outliers and remove the rows having outliers.
h. Discretize second column and create 5 bins
4. Consider two excel files having attendance of a workshop’s participants for two days. Each file has three
fields ‘Name’, ‘Time of joining’, duration (in minutes) where names are unique within a file. Note that duration
may take one of three values (30, 40, 50) only. Import the data into two dataframes and do the following:
a. Perform merging of the two dataframes to find the names of students who had attended the
workshop on both days.
b. Find names of all students who have attended workshop on either of the days.
c. Merge two data frames row-wise and find the total number of records in the data frame.
d. Merge two data frames and use two columns names and duration as multi-row indexes. Generate
descriptive statistics for this multi-index.
5. Taking Iris data, plot the following with proper legend and axis labels: (Download IRIS data from:
